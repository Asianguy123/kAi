# kAI
A-Level OCR CS H446 NEA => semi-retrieval AI based chatbot<br><br>

# Project Requirements

- Interface is a clean and simple dark theme, easy to view for the visually impaired
- 1280x720 resolution display
- Message display similar to that of a standard messaging app e.g. message bubbles, time of message
- Main menu with notification controls and application user instructions
- Topic prompts that focus AI conversation to the side of the message display
- Only takes keyboard and mouse inputs
- Outputs notification sound alerts (can be muted from menu)
- Uses as little storage space as possible
- Runs on Win10 and later versions as an .exe ==> runs as a .py file on Python 3.9 and later, provided all external libraries are installed and up to date

# How to Run and Use

**Raw Python File**:
<ol>
    <li>Download the zip file and extract the contents</li>
    <li>Install Python 3.9+</li>
    <li>Use pip to install tensorflow 2.11.0+, numpy 1.22.3+, nltk 3.7+, pygame 2.1.2+</li>
    <li>Run the 'graphics.py' file</li>
    <li>'kAi.exe' can be deleted to save storage space</li>
</ol>

**Executable**:
<ol>
    <li>Download the zip file and extract the contents</li>
    <li>Run 'kAi.exe'</li>
</ol>

User manual can be accessed at all times within the menu and chat window by clicking the help icon
